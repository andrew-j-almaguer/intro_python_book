To what value does the following expression evaluate?
'foo' == 'Foo'

This expression will return False since case matters
when comparing strings.

To compare the characters of two strings only while ignoring case,
one can use the casefold() function.

For example:
'foo'.casefold() == 'Foo'.casefold()

This expression will return True.
