What will the following code do? Why?
int('3.1415')

This code will return a ValueError. This is because the string '3.1415'
does not represent a valid integer.

To convert the string into an integer, one could could coerce it into a float
first and then use the int function on it like so:

number = float('3.1415')
number = int(number)
