To what value does the following expression evaluate?
'12' < '9'

This expression will return True.

These two operands are strings, not numbers, which means Python will compare
them one character at a time from left-to-right. On the first comparison,
Python rightly determines that 1 < 9, and so returns True immediately without
evaluating the entirety of both strings.
