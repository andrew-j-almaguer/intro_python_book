# Bob expects the following code to print the names in alphabetical order.
# Without running the code, can you say whether it will? Explain your answer.
names = { 'Chris', 'Clare', 'Karis', 'Karl',
          'Max', 'Nick', 'Victor' }
print(names)

# It may, but probably will not, print the names in alphabetical order because
# Bob has entered the names in a set, which is an unordered collection type.
# Insertion order does not matter in unordered collections.
